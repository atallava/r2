\title{Predictive Dynamics}
\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Predictive dynamics is different from system identification. Some references for
fitting dynamics. There is no underlying true model assumed. Good thing is more
powerful function classes, unfortunately minimum risk so don't get as good
bounds. Vidyasagar's reference. Introduce a mathematical notation.

\begin{itemize}
\item Generalization guarantees for learning from data. Shalizi's work. However
  this seems restrictive. What are more general assumptions under which they hold?
\item Domain adaptation for time-series data. Use as a simulator, want a warning system.
\item Predictive dynamics in optimal control. Drew's work.
\item Predictive dynamics in stability. Most out-there parts.
\end{\itemize}
